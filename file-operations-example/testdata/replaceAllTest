If 'Submatch' is present, the return value is a slice identifying the successive submatches of the expression.
 Submatches are matches of parenthesized subexpressions (also known as capturing groups) within the regular expression, 
 numbered from left to right in order of opening parenthesis. Submatch 0 is the match of the entire expression, 
 submatch 1 the match of the first parenthesized subexpression, and so on.
